Pushing a double(?) pointer:

push eax     ; eax is the esp value of old stack
mov eax, esp ; esp is a pointer to that value
push eax     ; push the pointer

...


pop eax      ; eax is new pointer from scheduler
mov esp, eax ; make esp point to adress in eax
pop eax      ; pop eax from adress where new esp is
